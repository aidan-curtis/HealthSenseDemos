# HealthSense Demos


## What is Healthsense?

HealthSense is a project by Rice Scalable Health that allows researchers to conduct large scale longitudinal studies that require survey questions and physiological data. Sign up is completely free. After you create an account on the HealthSense web portal, you can create studies, add questions to those studies, add participants to your study, set up an automated schedule for your study, and download the data at any time.

## Question Types

### Supported Question Types
1. *Multiple Choice* - Participants select from one of many options.
2. *Slider Questions* - Participants select anywhere on a range.
3. *GPS Location* - Longitude and Latitude from the participant's mobile device.
4. *Step Counter* - A record of steps taken from the participant's mobile device.
5. *iCO Smokerlyzer* - An external medical device that records CO in lungs.
6. *Heart Rate* - Tracking HR through apple watch.
7. *Image Capture* - Participants upload images according to prompt.
